## Participant 1

#userstudy-participant1

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

The localized predicates and projections made it easier to start speaking stuff rather than just think for too long; 
#userstudy-unbundling-less-planning-needed

whereas for SQL had to think and collect items for different tables. 
#userstudy-sql-planning-burden

For SpeakQL could just look at a table and collect items and then move onto another table.
#userstudy-unbundling-one-table-at-a-time

The count of/ the average of is much easier than count(),avg() when we are talking.
#userstudy-natural-functions-easier-when-talking

**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

All the synonyms was daunting, too many synonyms. 
#userstudy-too-many-synonyms

Was afraid of saying the incorrect synonym. Do we really need all these synonyms? How many do we need? Too many synonyms might create the perception of natural language which will cause them to create incorrect queries.
#userstudy-false-natural-language-problem

When there are more than two tables to join, the unbundling syntax is hard to use.

## Participant 2

#userstudy-participant2

**Do you have any suggestions for other expression reordering features that would make dictating queries easier?**

I am curious if we can reorder the groupby, having and order by statements just like the initial select.

#userstudy-suggest-modifier-reordering

Â **Do you have any suggestions for other function dictation features that would make dictating queries easier?**

None, I felt this was really good.

#userstudy-natural-functions-easier-when-talking 


**Do you have any suggestions for other complex query unbundling features that would make dictating queries easier?**

Though complex query bundling was easier, 
#userstudy-complex-unbundling-easier

it takes a lot of time to go from creating individual table queries, and then joins and then grouping them, and so because I was querying the columns from all the tables together first and then making all the joins in one go, I felt it a little inconvenient. 
#userstudy-complex-unbundling-syntax-difficult 

However, I missed the fact that I can simply query 2 tables and join and then go to the next table would have been easier. Definitely would suggest to pass this instruction to the next participant.
#userstudy-unbundling-order-options-good
#userstudy-need-practice 


**What changes could make you more likely to use the modifier ordering feature?**

I didn't realize this existed. One of my previous suggestions is the same as this. So I am glad that SpeakQL has this feature as well.

#userstudy-modifier-reording-good


**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

It is easier to create queries if construction can happen from Natural Language, 
#userstudy-general-positive-feedback

I really like this project. And also Kyle was patient and I felt the entire flow was good.

**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Yes, using the JOIN WITH 
#userstudy-join-synonyms-difficult 

and mentioning the QUOTES when comparing string fields.

## Participant 3

#userstudy-participant3

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Much cooler way of using SQL
#userstudy-general-positive-feedback 

**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

At times speaking the exact words like comma was a bit confusing, but comes easy with practice

## Participant 5

#userstudy-participant5

**What changes could make you more likely to use the natural function feature?**

I think it's a very useful feature 
#userstudy-natural-functions-useful

and I missed using it because of unfamiliarity with SpeakQL and strong familiarity/usage in SQL

## Participant 8

#userstudy-participant8

**Do you have any suggestions for other keywords that would make dictating queries easier?**

Sometimes I tend to say "THE TABLE course" for example, instead of "THE course TABLE".

#userstudy-suggestion-synonym-the-table

**What changes could make you more likely to use the expression ordering feature?**

Not really, I guess it's just I'm used to the SQL syntax.

#userstudy-sql-familiarity-less-speakql-use 


**Do you have any suggestions for other function dictation features that would make dictating queries easier?**

Omit left/right for cases without nested parenthesis, which I'd say happens much more often? But maybe this provides too little benefit.

#userstudy-dislike-punctuation-dictation 
#userstudy-suggestion-punctuation-no-leftright-paren


**Do you have any suggestions for other complex query unbundling features that would make dictating queries easier?**

Is it possible to make "GROUP BY automatically" automatically?

#userstudy-suggestion-syntax-groupby-automatically-automatic


**Do you have any suggestions for other expression modifier-related features that would make dictating queries easier?**

Maybe move having clauses into where clauses, especially in unbundled queries, and then auto-detect it and move to a SQL HAVING clause, if possible.

#userstudy-suggestion-syntax-unbundling-having-with-where


**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

No particular things, but I guess just in general the feel of using it in spoken context is much easier and natural.

#userstudy-general-positive-feedback 
#userstudy-natural-feel-easier


**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

I tend to get used to language syntax, especially well-designed languages, and thus I don't like having too much flexibility in the case of JOIN for example. But I guess this was done for NLP purposes, so I'm not objecting it 100%.

## Participant 6

#userstudy-participant6

**Do you have any suggestions for other keywords that would make dictating queries easier?**

Select synonyms - Retrieve
#userstudy-suggestion-synonym-retrieve

**What changes could make you more likely to use the expression ordering feature?**

If i use it more frequently that i have optional order i might start using it 
#userstudy-need-practice 
or atleast don't have to worry about ordering especially in bigger queries
#userstudy-ordering-might-use-with-practice


**Do you have any suggestions for other function dictation features that would make dictating queries easier?**

It seems intuitionally correct. So, good work capturing that
#userstudy-natural-functions-useful 


**Do you have any suggestions for other complex query unbundling features that would make dictating queries easier?**

Although it was helpful everytime to use 'And then' but i found it repetitive so not sure how to include this feedback to suggestion

#userstudy-unbundling-and-then-repetitive
#userstudy-complex-unbundling-syntax-difficult 


**Do you have any suggestions for other expression modifier-related features that would make dictating queries easier?**

Automatically is great option but felt less intuitional when speaking naturally

#userstudy-automatically-less-intuitive-less-natural


**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

It's certainly great step towards being intuitional speaking-wise in the basic SQL utlities.

#userstudy-general-positive-feedback 


**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Not sure if things like quotes, distinct , other joins (left,right,full outer) are handled already. From experience pvov, Quotes if not handled is a bit of a major issue if not handled already.

## Participant 10

#userstudy-participant10

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

SpeakQL definitely makes dictation of queries more natural without worrying a lot about the syntax (which would include the orders) and even the parentheses.

#userstudy-general-positive-feedback 
#userstudy-natural-feel-easier 

**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Found the usage of quote unnecessary, it would be great if SpeakQL takes care of this as well.

## Participant 11

#userstudy-participant11

**Do you have any suggestions for other keywords that would make dictating queries easier?**

The join synonyms can use some structural changes. Coming from SQL to SpeakQL, the join statement took me the longest to get used to.

#userstudy-join-synonyms-difficult 

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

I liked how it is highly structured similar to the SQL syntax, many features such as unbundling definitely improved the ease of usage compare to SQL.

#userstudy-easier-than-sql
#userstudy-easy-to-use 

**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

It takes quite a bit to get used to. 
#userstudy-need-practice 

Some statement seems a little out of place compare to the commonly used statement (ex: SELECT has many synonyms I can use, while LIMIT, GROUP BY doesn't, so I struggled to find the correct wording)
#userstudy-synonym-imbalance


## Participant 13

#userstudy-participant13

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

It is easy to use 
#userstudy-easy-to-use

and provides an efficient unbundling feature to break down complex queries.

## Participant 14

#userstudy-participant14

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Complex queries became easier

#userstudy-complex-querying-easier

**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Slight worries about the language nuances

#userstudy-language-nuance-concern


## Participant 16

#userstudy-participant16

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

What I like the most is that it is almost like thinking out loud. You just think about what you want to do, and say the query, which makes it way more convenient. 
#userstudy-thinking-out-loud
#userstudy-unbundling-less-planning-needed 

The ungrouping feature is particularly useful.

## Participant 19

#userstudy-participant19


**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

I could really understand the need for the bundling feature while using the SpeakQL dialect when I was formulating queries with multiple joins and same columns in multiple tables.
#userstudy-unbundling-no-ambiguous-columns

Since I did not have to worry about ambiguous column names, I could write the bundles separately faster and join them all later on. 
#userstudy-unbundling-feels-faster

Using SQL, I would need to be more aware of the aliases of the columns and the tables while writing the query.

## Participant 20

#userstudy-participant20

**Was there anything else that you liked about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Interesting to speak SQL
#userstudy-general-positive-feedback 


**Was there anything else that you DID NOT like about your experience using the SpeakQL dialect?**

Unbundling is slightly difficult to interpret in the first time
